First and foremost, Venera is a tool driven by my necessities and learning goals, so many features may not make that sense for you as a user.

Feel free to bring new perspectives and ideas. Any type of contribution is always welcome.

The main channel for bringing contributions is by creating [issues](https://github.com/farinap5/Venera/issues). It is the first way we use to organize the demands. 

If you are looking for a way to contribute with the project, start by reading the [issues](https://github.com/farinap5/Venera/issues), there may have something you can do for the project, like help write or translate documentation, improve code, interface as user usability and so on.

We have the python script `todo.py`. It lists all `TODO` comments written during the code. It is just another way to map improvements for the future of that function.
