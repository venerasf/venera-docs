You may opt to use the precompiled binary. However, this option will be more limited in terms of compatible architectures and systems, as the author only compiles for the systems he uses, which will likely always be Linux AMD64.

Go to the [github release page](https://github.com/venerasf/Venera/releases/) and download it.

```bash
wget https://github.com/venerasf/Venera/releases/download/v1.2/Venera-linux-x84-64
```

Now, move the binary to `/usr/bin` or another directory included in your **PATH**.

Run `venera` and and follow the first steps.
