To achieve the goal of having a simple and very effective scripting system `venera` has the ability to run scripts written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/docs.html) as it has a coupled interpreter. The user is able to utilize all the power provided by a scripting language like Lua.

As this is a widely used language in embedded systems, game systems and so on, it has the advantage of being powerful, very light and fast but extremely simple to write algorithms with it.

To write code for `venera` it is necessary to have a Lua language base, so contact the documentation at the following link: [www.lua.org/docs.html](https://www.lua.org/docs.html).
